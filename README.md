# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service so that businesses can take proactive retention actions.

The project uses a real-world style dataset (Lloyds Banking–inspired) and follows an **end-to-end ML workflow**, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn leads to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.
By predicting churn in advance, companies can:

* Target high-risk customers
* Improve retention strategies
* Optimize marketing and customer support efforts

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior
* Cleaned and preprocessed raw data
* Engineered relevant features
* Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** for churn prediction
* Saved the trained model for reuse and deployment

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Python script
